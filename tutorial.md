<div id="direct-download"></div>

## 1 Download content directly from OnlyFans page
  The extension allows you to download content from two possible places: directly from the OnlyFans site or by a popup window that opens up when you click on the extension icon. Here we'll cover the first case.
  
  While navigating in OnlyFans, below each post you will be able to see the following buttons:
  
<div>
  <img src="./assets/images/docs/below_posts.png" alt="Buttons below posts" class="tutorial-img">
  
</div>
  
  Here's a summary of each button's action:
  
<table class="tutorial-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Button text</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Xtract photo</td>
<td>Downloads the photo to your PC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xtract video</td>
<td>Downloads the video to your PC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xtract ALL</td>
<td>Download all photos and videos from the current post to your pc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Xtract links</td>
<td>Copy the links to download the photos and videos to your clipboard</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## 2 Download content from the extension page

To enable this option, you have to click on the extension button that is displayed in your browser's bar:

<div>
  <img src="./assets/images/docs/ext_button.png" alt="" class="tutorial-img">
</div>

The following window will pop up:

<div>
  <img src="./assets/images/docs/initial_popup.png" alt="" class="tutorial-img">
</div>

As you can see, it prompts you to select a user. When you click that message, a list with all your subscriptions will be displayed:

<div>
  <img src="./assets/images/docs/user_list.png" alt="" class="tutorial-img">
</div>

## 2.1 Extension page layout
