<div id="direct-download"></div>

## 1 Download content directly from OnlyFans page
  The extension allows you to download content from two possible places: directly from the OnlyFans site or by a popup window that opens up when you click on the extension icon. Here we'll cover the first case.
  
  While navigating in OnlyFans, below each post you will be able to see the following buttons:
  
<div>
  <img src="./assets/images/docs/below_posts.png" alt="Buttons below posts" class="tutorial-img">
  
</div>
  
  Here's a summary of each button's action:
  
<table class="tutorial-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Button text</th>
<th>Action</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Xtract photo</td>

            You HAVE TO click on this button while being on a tab where OnlyFans is open. Otherwise you'll get a message
            saying so...

<div id="posts"></div>
## 2.1 Posts tab

While being in the posts tab, you will be able to retrieve the selected creator's posts that contain multimedia.

<div class="alert-box-warning">
          <h4>Important!</h4>
          <p>
            Posts that only contain text, but no photo/video/audio will not be displayed. The extension's main purpose is to download multimedia, not
            browse OnlyFans posts.
            Also, posts contaning locked media (media you have to purchase to see, but you haven't purchased yet) will not be displayed either. Once you purchase
            locked media, then you will be able to download it using this extension
          </p>
</div>

First you have to select wether you want to select regular posts (posts you usually see when yo go to the creator's page in OnlyFans) or archived posts (posts the creator removed from the main feed but are still accessible from the archived section in OnlyFans).

Then indicate if you want to get: Posts in custom date range, posts since yesterday, posts since last week (7 days back until today) or all the posts since the creator joined OnlyFans.
If you selected posts in custom date range, then you will have to provide the "date from" and "date to" (default = today) that will be used to search for posts. For all other options, "date from" and "date to" are automatically filled.

Finally hit the search button (magnifying glass) and see the magic happen!

Depending on the number of posts the user has according to the selection criteria you entered, the main table will be filled like this:
<div>
  <img src="./assets/images/docs/posts.png" alt="" class="tutorial-img">
</div>

As you can see, the table displays the thumbnail of the multimedia, duration (only in the case of videos), media type, publish date and post text (if any).

Above the table the following controls are enabled:
* **Pictures:** Select/unselect all pictures from the table
* **Videos:** Select/unselect all videos from the table
* **Xtract selected:** Download the selected multimedia to your hard drive
* **Xtract links:** Copy the links to the selected multimedia to the clipboard
* **Multimedia found:** Indicates the number of photos, videos and audios being displayed in the table

            will not be shown.
          </p>

<div id="install"></div>
## 3 Install extension manually before it's published

Sometimes I'll come up with a new version of the app that fixes some bugs or introduce new features. Well, Chrome and Firefox stores sometimes take a long time to review the new version before allowing it to be published (especially Chrome). That's why I give you the option to download the new version from this site and install it manually until it's officially available in the stores. (You may go to the [downloads section](/downloads) to find the latest version).

The steps to add an extension manually differs for each browser. Please go to the tutorial section corresponding to the browser where you want to install it.
